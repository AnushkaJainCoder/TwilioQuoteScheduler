# TwilioQuoteScheduler

## Overview

TwilioQuoteScheduler is a simple service designed to send scheduled inspirational quotes via SMS using Twilio's API. This service can be configured to send personalized messages at specific times and can handle multiple recipients. It is ideal for sending daily motivational quotes or reminders to users.

## Features

- **Scheduled Messaging**: Send quotes or messages at specified times.
- **Multiple Recipients**: Add multiple phone numbers to receive scheduled quotes.
- **Customizable Quotes**: Use a predefined set of quotes or customize them according to your needs.
- **Twilio Integration**: Leverages Twilio's API to handle SMS delivery.
- **Error Handling**: In case of delivery failures, retry mechanisms and error logging are implemented.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Twilio Account**: Sign up for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to get your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.
- **Node.js**: This project is built using Node.js. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB** (Optional): For persistent storage of scheduled messages and user information.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TwilioQuoteScheduler.git
   cd TwilioQuoteScheduler
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```bash
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   After configuring the environment, start the application using:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Scheduling Messages**: Users can be added with their phone numbers and scheduled to receive quotes at specific times.
2. **Sending SMS**: At the specified times, the application sends an SMS to each user using the Twilio API.
3. **Error Handling**: In case an SMS fails to send, the application retries a few times and logs the error for review.

## Example Usage

```js
const { scheduleMessage } = require('./scheduler');

// Schedule a quote to be sent at 9 AM every day
scheduleMessage({
  phoneNumber: '+1234567890',
  message: 'Keep pushing forward!',
  schedule: '0 9 * * *', // Cron syntax for daily at 9 AM
});
```

## Dependencies

- [Twilio SDK](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node) – For sending SMS.
- [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) – For scheduling tasks.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) – For environment variable management.

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration**: Add MongoDB to store user data and message history.
- **UI**: Develop a web interface for easy management of scheduled quotes and users.
- **Notifications**: Add email notifications alongside SMS.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for monitoring and managing the messages.
